# Credit-Card-Default-Analysis-R-Machine-Learning

This is the project I did for my final project submission in my academic course "Introduction to Data Science". 

This [dataset](https://github.com/riddhimistryy/Credit-Card-Default-Analysis-R-Machine-Learning/blob/main/creditcardclientsdefault.csv) is a real credit approval dataset available at [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients).
The project involves the following components: 

1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Choosing most appropriate predictor variables
3. Implementing logit and probit regression
4. Selecting the best fitting model
5. Training a classifier on outcome default

After implementing and comparing two models - KNN and Naive Bayes, KNN gave an accuracy of 77% and Naive Bayes gave an accuracy of 80.2% in detecting credit card default. 

Thus, Naive Bayes was chosen as the optimal model for predicting default for credit card clients.
