# Credit-Card-Fraud-Analysis-R-Machine-Learning

This is the project I did for my final project submission in my academic course "Introduction to Data Science". 

This dataset is a real credit approval dataset available at [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients).
